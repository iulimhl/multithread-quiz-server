## How to Run
1. Compile the server:
   gcc server.c -lpthread -o server
   ./server
2. In separate terminals, compile and start clients:
   gcc client.c -o client
   ./client
3. Each client will:
  -Connect to the server via TCP socket
  -Wait for their turn to answer
  -Receive a multiple-choice question (from SQLite or XML)
  -Send their selected answer within the allowed time (e.g., 10 seconds)
4. The server will:
  -Handle each client in a separate thread
  -Track scores and validate answers
  -Continue the quiz even if some clients disconnect
  -Announce the final score and winner when all questions are done
